        <h1 id="1">Introduction</h1>
        JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It
        is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for
        example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
        its environment to provide programmatic control over them. JavaScript
        contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math,
        and a core set of language elements such as operators, control
        structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a
        variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for
        example: Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
        objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For
        example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements
        on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form
        input, and page navigation. Server-side JavaScript extends the core
        language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a
        server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to
        communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one
        invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations
        on a server.
        <h1 id="2">What you should already know</h1>
        This guide assumes you have the following basic background: A general
        understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW). Good working
        knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML). Some programming
        experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials
        linked on the main page about JavaScript.
        <h1 id="3">JavaScript and Java</h1>
        JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different
        in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have
        Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most
        Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow
        constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to
        JavaScript. In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built
        by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
        number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.
        JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common
        class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic
        inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects.
        JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative
        requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as
        loosely typed methods. JavaScript is a very free-form language compared
        to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods.
        You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public,
        private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces.
        Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly
        typed.

        <h1 id="4">Hello world</h1>
        To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write
        your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:

        <code>
          function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); } <br />
          greetMe("World");
        </code>
        Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your
        browser!

        <h1 id="5">Variables</h1>
        You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The
        names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules. A
        JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
        dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because
        JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through
        "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase). You can
        use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You
        can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers.
        Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.

        <h1 id="6">Declaring variables</h1>
        You can declare a variable in three ways: With the keyword var. For
        example, var x = 42. This syntax can be used to declare both local and
        global variables. By simply assigning it a value. For example, x = 42.
        This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript
        warning. You shouldn't use this variant. With the keyword let. For
        example, let y = 13. This syntax can be used to declare a block scope
        local variable. See Variable scope below.

        <h1 id="7">Variable scope</h1>
        When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
        global variable, because it is available to any other code in the
        current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is
        called a local variable, because it is available only within that
        function. JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block
        statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to
        the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For
        example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the
        function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block,
        which in this case is an if statement. if (true) { var x = 5; }
        console.log(x); // 5 This behavior changes, when using the let
        declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015. if (true) { let y = 5; }
        console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined

        <h1 id="8">Global variables</h1>
        Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web
        pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global
        variables using the window.variable syntax. Consequently, you can access
        global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or
        frame by specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable
        called phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to this
        variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.

        <h1 id="9">Constants</h1>
        You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The
        syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable
        identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and
        can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters. const PI =
        3.14; A constant cannot change value through assignment or be
        re-declared while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a
        value. The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block
        scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is
        assumed to represent a variable. You cannot declare a constant with the
        same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For example: //
        THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS WILL
        CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g; //statements }
        However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement
        is executed without problems. const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"};
        MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";

        <h1 id="10">Data types</h1>
        The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types: Six data types
        that are primitives: Boolean. true and false. null. A special keyword
        denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not
        the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant. undefined. A top-level
        property whose value is undefined. Number. 42 or 3.14159. String.
        "Howdy" Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are
        unique and immutable. and Object Although these data types are a
        relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful functions
        with your applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental
        elements in the language. You can think of objects as named containers
        for values, and functions as procedures that your application can
        perform.

        <h1 id="11">if...else statement</h1>
        Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is
        true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the
        condition is false. An if statement looks as follows: if (condition) {
        statement_1; } else { statement_2; } condition can be any expression
        that evaluates to true or false. See Boolean for an explanation of what
        evaluates to true and false. If condition evaluates to true, statement_1
        is executed; otherwise, statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and
        statement_2 can be any statement, including further nested if
        statements. You may also compound the statements using else if to have
        multiple conditions tested in sequence, as follows: if (condition_1) {
        statement_1; } else if (condition_2) { statement_2; } else if
        (condition_n) { statement_n; } else { statement_last; } In the case of
        multiple conditions only the first logical condition which evaluates to
        true will be executed. To execute multiple statements, group them within
        a block statement ({ ... }) . In general, it's good practice to always
        use block statements, especially when nesting if statements: if
        (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
        statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
        statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
        statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; } It is advisable to not use
        simple assignments in a conditional expression, because the assignment
        can be confused with equality when glancing over the code. For example,
        do not use the following code: if (x = y) { /* statements here */ } If
        you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a common
        practice is to put additional parentheses around the assignment. For
        example: if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }

        <h1 id="12">while statement</h1>
        A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified
        condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows: while
        (condition) statement If the condition becomes false, statement within
        the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following
        the loop. The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is
        executed. If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the
        condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution
        stops and control is passed to the statement following while. To execute
        multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those
        statements. Example: The following while loop iterates as long as n is
        less than three: var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n < 3) { n++; x += n; }
        With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x.
        Therefore, x and n take on the following values: After the first pass: n
        = 1 and x = 1 After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3 After the third
        pass: n = 3 and x = 6 After completing the third pass, the condition n <
        3 is no longer true, so the loop terminates.

        <h1 id="13">Function declarations</h1>
        A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function
        statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by: The name of
        the function. A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in
        parentheses and separated by commas. The JavaScript statements that
        define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }. For example, the
        following code defines a simple function named square: function
        square(number) { return number * number; } The function square takes one
        argument, called number. The function consists of one statement that
        says to return the argument of the function (that is, number) multiplied
        by itself. The return statement specifies the value returned by the
        function. return number * number; Primitive parameters (such as a
        number) are passed to functions by value; the value is passed to the
        function, but if the function changes the value of the parameter, this
        change is not reflected globally or in the calling function.
